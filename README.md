# C-elegant-vs-No-C-elegant


There was total 11000 images of 2 classes “worm and 
no_worm”. Each image was labeled with 2 class, 1= worm and 
0=no worm. Goal was  to build a model that will classify if there is an worm or no_worm.

A small visualization of the training Data:

Testing information presented as a confusion matrix and the classification accuracy:

The test file asks an directory selected by the user and then finds if there is an worm or no_worm. Then it shows 
Two-column list with the first column indicating the image 
filenames and the second column indicating the corresponding 
label: 1 (worm) or 0 (no worm)
